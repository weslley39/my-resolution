This is a simple todo app to improve my skills about react and meteor

##What are you using ?
Like a said before, react and meteor.

So, if you want to run this awesome project in your local machine, just [install meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) and you are ready to go!

If you discover anything wrong, be my guest to send me a PR fixing, or open an issue that i will fix later :)
